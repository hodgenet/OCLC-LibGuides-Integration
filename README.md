# OCLC-LibGuides-Integration
#
# This is a single script, makeDb4LGonline.pl, that is used to make a delimited database file for loading into Libguides. It's
# a basic CGI script that requires some knowledge of Perl to install, and requires 2 locally-developed authentication modules,
# present in the OCLC-APIs repository.
